#112. Path Sum
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

#203. Remove Linked List Elements
Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.
Example
Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6, val = 6
Return: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5

#113. Path Sum II
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1
RETURN
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]

#129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
