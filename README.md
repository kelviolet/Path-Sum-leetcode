#112. Path Sum
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

#203. Remove Linked List Elements
Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.
Example
Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6, val = 6
Return: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5

#113. Path Sum II
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1
RETURN
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]

#129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

#190. Reverse Bits
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

#191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
